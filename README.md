React Color Palette Generator App
This React application allows users to enter a word in an input box, submits that word to a Google Custom Search Engine to fetch related images, and then uses the ColorThief library to extract and display color palettes from these images. This README provides detailed information on the app's functionality, setup, usage, and contributing guidelines.

Features
Keyword Input: Users can type any word into an input field to find related images.
Submit and Reset Buttons: A submit button fetches images related to the input word, and a reset button clears the input and the displayed results.
Google Custom Search Engine Integration: Utilizes the Google Custom Search Engine to fetch images based on the input keyword.
Color Palette Extraction: Extracts color palettes from the fetched images using the ColorThief library.
Display Color Cards: Displays color cards with hex values for the colors in the extracted palette.
